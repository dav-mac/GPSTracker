!!!before checking this out make sure that the blue LED in the Neo 6M is blinking. Basically the blinking of blue LED means that its receiving the data perfectly. Generally it takes few minutes to blink the LED after giving power to the module. So wait until that. And if its not blinking even after 5 minutes then go to a window side area or any place under the open sky. In the image below you can see how the blue LED should blink.
