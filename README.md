You're going to need:
- A RaspberryPi Zero W (and associated cables)
- A neo 6M GPS module
- A power pack
- Wifi access (you'll need the network and password information)
- A laptop to which you can connect USB devices
- A google account (also let's you access Firebase and Google Map developer)
- A GitHub account
- For those on non-mac machines you will need Putty loaded
