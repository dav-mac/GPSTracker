edit the /boot/config.txt file
Now you need to open this file in any text editor. Here I am using nano:
sudo nano /boot/config.txt

At the end of the file add the follwing lines:

dtparam=spi=on
dtoverlay=pi3-disable-bt
core_freq=250
enable_uart=1
force_turbo=1

It will look something like this:

PICTURE TO ADD

Now save this by typing ctrl +x, then type y and press enter.


Raspbian uses the UART as a serial console and so we need to turn off that functionality. To do so we need to change the /boot/cmdline.txt file. For safety before editing the file make a backup of that using the following command:

sudo cp /boot/cmdline.txt /boot/cmdline_backup.txt

Replace the content with the follwing line (delete everything in it and write down the following content):

dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline fsck.repair=yes rootwait quiet splash plymouth.ignore-serial-consoles

Now save this by typing ctrl +x, then type y and press enter.

Now reboot pi using:

sudo reboot

After the reboot now its time to check how our GPS module is working.
